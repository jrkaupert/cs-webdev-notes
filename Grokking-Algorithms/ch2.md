## How Memory Works
Think of a chest of drawers...

If you need to store something, and if you assume each drawer can hold one
thing, this chest is a way of thinking about how a computer stores things in
memory.

Each "drawer" or slot in memory has an address and can hold one thing.

If you want to store multiple
items, you can do it one of two ways, using an array or a list.

## Arrays and Linked Lists
> **Arrays** store things contiguously in memory, one after the other

Adding new items to an array when the computer has no more contiguous memory
requires the computer to move the entire array.

Sometimes it's necessary to have the computer hold space in reserve when you know how large you may want the array to grow

This can be wasted space if you don't use it

The array may grow larger at some point anyways and then require
being moved

> **Linked lists** let items be stored anywhere in memory (random locations)
