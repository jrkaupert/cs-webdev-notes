# Notes from You Don't Know Javascript - Up & Going #
[https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](You Don't Know Javascript)

# Chapter 1: Into Programming #
## Statements ##
- *Statements* are a series of words, numbers, and operators that perform a
specific task
- *Variables* are little boxes to store values in
- *Literal Values* are just values not stored in variables
- *Operators* allow you to perform actions using variables/values

## Expressions ##
- Statements made up of >= 1 expression, which combine variables, values, and
operators
- Types of expressions
  1. literal value expressions - just a value
  2. variable expressions - retrieve variable value
  3. arithmetic expressions - perform arithmetic
  4. assignment expressions - assign result of an operation to variable
  5. call expressions - function calls

## Executing a Program ##
- Computer runs statements via interpreter or compiler to translate code into
something it knows how to work with
- JavaScript is usually called *interpreted* but is actually *compiled* in
real-time and then immediately run

## Try It Yourself ##
- Code can be executed in the JavaScript console of browser dev tools
- `console.log(stuff);` lets you print to console
- `alert(stuff);` can be used to display a popup box with an "OK" button
- `aVariable = prompt("text");` can be used to prompt user and save their input

## Operators ##
- Operators let us act on variables and values
- Variables should always be declared in advance with *var*

Types of operators:
- Assignment: =
- Mathematical: + - / *
- Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=.  a+=2 is same as a = a + 2
- Object Property Access: . (like console.log)
- Equality:
  - == (loose equals)
  - === (strict equals)
  - != (loose not equals)
  - !== (strict not equals)
- Comparison: <, >, <= (less than or loose equals), >= (greater than or loose
equals)
- Logical: &&, ||
